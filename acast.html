                <h2 class="smallHeader">CHALLENGE</h2>
                <p>Acast, one of the biggest podcast providers in Sweden, hosted a 2-day design sprint for approximately
                    100 Hyper Island students. They recently launched a free subscription level to their distribution
                    service for podcast creators and wants to get new users to sign up. Their brief was to create a 360
                    marketing campaign that clearly states that Acast is the place to be if you have a voice and a story
                    to tell.
                </p>
                <p>To determine the winner of the sprint, they scored it on 4 criteria: Innovation and Creativity,
                    Implementable, Scalability and Reach and finally Lead Generation. The team contributed equally on
                    tasks such as research and ideation but divided into different roles when preparing to present our
                    concept. </p>

        <h2 class="bigHeader">ALIGNMENT</h2>
        <p>Our sprint mentor introduced us to the suggested creative process for the sprint: Alignment - Ideation -
            Development. The first stage was all about breaking down the brief into a focus question, and doing rapid
            research to guide us in the right direction.

        <p> We ended up rephrasing the brief into ”How might we empower new podcasters to share their stories?” before
            moving onto rapid research, where we found a lot of valuable insights. Most notably, one team member had a
            short interview with her podcaster friend about why she started her podcast and learned that it was because
            the friend constantly found herself in situations and conversations where she thought ”this should’ve been
            recorded”. This ended up becoming the foundation for our campaign strategy.</p>

    <section class="projectPage" id="ideationSection">
        <h2 class="bigHeader">IDEATION</h2>
        <p>We did a Crazy 8 exercise to also explore other ideas not relating to the interview quote, and went through a
            process of sorting through and clustering the ideas. However, when we did the final dot voting we ended up
            going in the initial direction. After exploring other concepts, all of us still agreed this was an
            emotionally engaging and unique concept to build a campaign on.
        </p>
        <p>We sketched on how the idea could take shape as a campaign and decided that it will start out as a video ad
            campaign with multiple videos with different people being in conversations in different contexts saying
            ”This should’ve been recorded”, and that the videos should end with ”At Acast, we think so too. You press
            record, we put it out there”.
        </p>

    <section class="projectPage" id="developmentSection">
        <h2 class="bigHeader">DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <p>We made mockups of how the video ads could take form and be distributed on platforms like Youtube and
            Instagram, as well as channels like TV and digital billboards.
        <p>
            However, we also went the extra mile and added another layer to the campaign to make it even more engaging
            and interactive. The idea was to create a challenge for Instagram where users are encouraged to share an
            Instagram Story of them using an Acast AR filter while talking about a story they wish would have been
            recorde, tagging @acastsweden and using #ThisShouldBeRecorded. There would then be some type of voting on
            the submitted Stories and a winner.
        </p>
        <p>We assessed that the campaign was simple, primarily driven by user-generated content, based on organic
            sharing, budget-friendly and creating a sense of community.</p>

        <p class="testimonialHeader">In the end, the concept was a big success. Our team won the sprint and got this feedback:</p>
        <span class="testimonialQuote">
            ”Wow! Maybe you saw my face so I don’t have to take too much time to give feedback, because it was brilliant. And I loved the fact that you shared the creator’s wishes and insights with Acast’s wish by saying that you have something you want to record, and that at Acast we want so too. It’s a very nice way of sewing us all together. The whole concept overall is great.”</span> <br>
