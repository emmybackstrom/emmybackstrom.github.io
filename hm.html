                <h2 class="smallHeader">CHALLENGE</h2>
                <p>H&M Group, a company consisting of some of the biggest global fashion brands, was our client during
                    the Human Centered Design module at Hyper Island. Their brief for us was to design a new digital
                    product or service that solved identified customer needs while supporting long lasting engagement
                    beyond just a transactional relationship with the target group (women aged 16-22). We got to choose
                    one of their three most youthful brands to work with; Weekday, Monki or H&M Divided. My team chose
                    H&M Divided as we found that customers felt the least emotionally engaged with this brand. </p>

        <h2 class="bigHeader">RESEARCH</h2>
        <p>We started to get to know our users through a survey, in which we asked questions about their favorite
            brands, shopping habits, what makes for a good or bad experience etc. This was a great starting point
            because it gave us quantative data, from which we could see patterns and draw conclusions. We synthesized
            the data into insights through user journey mapping, where we found that a low point, both in the online and
            in-store shopping journey, was keeping the garment. To understand why, we made an interview guide and had
            fewer, qualitative in-depth interviews.</p>

        <p>From our interviews we identified several interesting behaviors which explained the negative feelings around
            keeping a garment. The users felt guilty because they were prone to impulse buy and also because they didn’t
            know how to take care of their clothes which lead to discarding them. </p>

    <section class="projectPage" id="ideationSection">
        <h2 class="bigHeader">IDEATION</h2>
        <p>To guide us in ideation, we asked ourselves the question “How might we improve young women’s relationship
            with Divided and help them change the shopping behaviours they’re stressed about?”.</p>
        <p>We used the Jobs To Be Done framework in order to ensure our solution provides value for the user. Some user
            jobs we defined were:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>1. taking care of garments instead of throwing them away,</li>
            <li>2. using old garments in new creative ways,</li>
            <li>3. minimizing unnecessary consumption.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We ideated while keeping in mind that all ideas should help the user achieve one of these jobs. The solution
            we came up with is called Together by Divided: an app that will help the user prolong their garments’
            lifecycle through inspiration on how to use their garments in new ways + easily accessible care advice.</p>

    <section class="projectPage" id="prototypingSection">
        <h2 class="bigHeader">PROTOTYPING</h2>
        <p>When we had come up with an idea that we thought would help users accomplish their jobs, we made lo-fi
            sketches and put them into the simple prototype tool POP.
        </p>
        <p>
            To test the prototype, we asked users to accomplish different tasks and describe their experience. We got
            very positive feedback on the features, but had some redesigning to do when it came to the structure and
            flows. When these changes were in place, I developed the Hi-Fi prototype using Adobe XD with assistance from
            the visual designer on the team.

    <section class="projectPage" id="deliverableSection">
        <h2 class="bigHeader">DELIVERABLE</h2>
        <p>Our final delivery, a Hi-Fi prototype of Together by Divided, was handed over together with the extensive
            user insights we gained as a result of thorough research.

        </p>
        <p>
            The app provides the customer with tools for a happy relationship with her garment in order to prolong its
            life cycle, and shows that her relationship with Divided doesn’t end at the point of purchase but
            rather begins. The main features are garment-specific care instructions and upcycle inspiration through a
            garment timeline called the "Journey of Love", with additional features like a closet overview and wishlist
            to make the most out of what she already has. This creates a rewarding experience for the user and supports
            a more meaningful relationship between the person and her clothes, and ultimately with Divided.
