                <p>29k is a mental health app with courses, challenges, meditations and other content meant to
                    facilitate personal development. During my internship at 29k, there was an org-wide hackathon in
                    which everyone had 2 days to come up with, develop and pitch an idea which would support 29k’s
                    mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something which I had previously identified as a problem through UX research was that new users
                    experience a lack of guidance and aren’t sure what to do or how to work towards a goal after
                    creating an
                    account. This in turn leads to a low retention rate, which is why I chose to focus on how to solve
                    this
                    problem.

        <h2 class="bigHeader">PROBLEM FRAMING</h2>
        <p>Though I started with a problem in mind, it wasn’t specific enough and clearly defined. More importantly, I
            wanted to challenge my problem by asking a set of questions to be sure it was a relevant problem to solve.
            Therefore, I went through the process of problem framing in order to have one clear problem statement for
            ideation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using a workshop structure from Design Sprint Academy, I identified what type of user is affected by the
            problem, what their experience is like when they are, in what contexts they’re affected and finally
            connected it
            to both user and business values. I ended up with the problem statement “People who are new to actively
            working
            on personal development lack guidance when planning activities and creating habits which support personal
            growth. We need to provide guidance for defining what areas they want to develop in, and how to go about
            it.”.

    <section class="projectPage" id="ideationSection">
        <h2 class="bigHeader">IDEATION</h2>
        <p>When moving from problem framing to ideation, I used my problem statement to formulate a concise focus
            question: “How might we make users feel encouraged to use the app?”. I used the same ideation process as in
            a previous sprint I had done, and therefore went on to rapid research about my topic for 15 minutes to get
            ideas of what other companies are doing to address this.
        </p>
        <p>
            After getting inspiration, I came up with 4 concepts: Personalized plan, Rewarding illustration and copy
            after activity, Streaks and Badges. After asking my team members for feedback, and learning from our
            psychologists why gamification features like streaks and badges aren’t effective in contexts which involve
            deep focus and effort, I decided to develop the first two ideas.</p>

        <h2 class="bigHeader">DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <p>
            For the personalized plan, I envisioned that as a final stage in onboarding the user would get the chance to
            answer two simple questions about their intention with using the app and based from that get a growth plan.
            This plan would contain a daily, weekly and monthly overview of curated exercises relating to what the user
            answered that they were interested in. The plan helps tackle many of the problems I identified during the
            first stage, like providing guidance on what to do in order to reach goals, staying motivated by being able
            to view progress etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rewarding illustration and copy was a one screen design where I aimed to improve the final screen of
            doing an activity in the app. I implemented a progress bar which shows a users overall progress on their
            personal growth plan, and illustrated a character which provides a more unique and original impression than
            a stock photo.

        <span class="testimonialQuote">”In this project, after only spending a handfull of days with our team, Emmy has
            identified an area in our app that multiple user interviews and data analysis confirmed as crucial for user
            engagement and retention. By asking users two simple questions very early in their journey, we would not
            only be able to tailor what we offer to individual user’s needs, but also get to know our users better, in
            general. Unlike an ordinary survey, users’ motivation to answer those questions would be their own benefit,
            and the questions would feel inspiring and validating rather than intrusive.
        </span>
        <span class="testimonialQuote">
            Overall, we’ve been hugely impressed by the cleverness, elegance and neat design of this project, even
            without considering the short time they were done in and the very limited introduction Emmy has had into our
            product and UX research around it. It fits so perfectly into what the app already has, while adding huge
            value with small means.”
