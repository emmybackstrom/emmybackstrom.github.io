                <p>Goalplan is a software company helping large, complex, and distributed sales organizations improve

                <p>
                    As they’re growing from a start-up to a scale-up, Goalplan feels a need to establish a strong brand
                    which visually attracts the various C-Level executives in their targeted industries (retail, MLM,
                    retail banking, and telecom) across multiple continents as well as appealing to the end-users of
                    their application. Goalplan also expressed the importance of having a unique identity which stands
                    out among a sea of similar-looking corporate identities.</p>

        <h2 class="bigHeader">RESEARCH</h2>
        <p>
            In order for us to get a solid understanding of what exactly wasn’t effective about their current visual
            identity, we analyzed all of their channels and platforms and performed a visual audit in which we compared
            Goalplan to similar brands. Insights that came up concerned the lack of uniqueness (using a generic logo,
            generic website template and stock photos) and that most other brands similar to Goalplan had a serious
            identity
            using typical corporate blue as their primary color.
        </p>
        <p>
            This gave us the first springboard in designing new visuals, but what was also important before moving on
            was
            getting a strong strategic foundation in place. In initial meetings, it became clear that the Goalplan team
            didn’t share the same perspective on the mission, vision and personality of Goalplan. Therefore, we
            facilitated
            a workshop designed to get them aligned on strategy so that we would ideate in the right direction in the
            following stage of the process.

        <h2 class="bigHeader">IDEATION</h2>
        <p>
            After research, it was clear that the strategic foundation would be based on the brand being friendly,
            approachable and modern in contrast to the more serious competitors. This will help Goalplan be unique and
            have
            a brand that is not only attractive to C-level executives but also by frontliners.
        </p>
        <p>
            With that in mind, we explored the visual direction through stylescapes. We created different stylescapes
            with
            various typography, colors, imagery and iconography style and presented this to the client. After picking
            and
            mixing the best bits of each stylescape, we moved on to creating the comprehensive brand guideline and
            additional assets.
